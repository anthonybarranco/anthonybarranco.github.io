I've always been interested in data. For work, I've created formulas in Google Sheets that output data points showing trends in social shares, ad performance and more. But, the time to set these types of programs up could take months, with many trial and errors. With that said, it still is not a perfect mathematical science. Which is why I wanted to attempt to take these skills to an environment meant for such an output, and expand my "tool kit," if you will. 

Admittingly, the first couple of lessons came as a bit of a wake-up call. I have written code in HTML and CSS, but these have all been in structured settings. This appears to be the beginning of a large learning curve, one that is exciting to take on. I described what I am about to learn to a friend of mine as half a new language, and half mathematics. The new language part of that seems to be ringing true right about now.
