As a digital marketer by trade, it is critical to not only present findings through clean and objective data, but also in a way that's easily understood. Much of what I deal with on a daily basis is difficult to comprehend for those in different departments (completely understandable, of course). Much of the data digital marketers deal with inspire company-wide decisions, since it both relates to revenue going in and going out.

So, when presenting important data to decision-makers, it's almost necessary to present it in a way that can be easily digestible. Line, bar and histograms are just a few ways data points can be presented in a "digestible" manner. Honestly, there is no favorite as far which one does a better job demonstrating key data findings. These act more as tools in a tool box. Line graphs tend to do a better job marking trends over-time. Bar graphs do a better job outlining differences in groups of data. Histograms are more niche in their use, and are used less often as the aforementioned. 

With a tool box of graphs to map out data points, it's now up to the data to speak for itself.
